# Game List :video_game:

### A project made with an [intensive course by Dr. NÃ©lio on DevSuperior.](devsuperior.com.br)

**I used Java Spring with:**
- lombok
- Data JPA
- Spring Web
- Postgres Server
- H2 DataBase

### In this course, we created a structure on Spring following best practices for a game list back-end project.

- Entities and ORM
- Controller, service, repository
- DTO Pattern
- N:N Entity Relationships
- Developing profiles:
  - test (DB H2)
  - dev (Postgres homologation)
  - prod (Postgres production)
- We used **Docker** with **DBeaver** and **Postgres** to use a local database, and supplied **Postgres** data on [_Railway.app_](https://railway.app/).

### I added something to the course content.
- Added `lombok` dependency to use `Getters, Setters, Constructors, Equals, and HashCode` annotations.
- Created a method to add games to the application.
  
_See you._
